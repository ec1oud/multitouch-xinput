# multitouch-xinput
mttest, an old XInput test program

I found this in 2012 or so while trying to understand how to add XInput 2.2
multi-touch support to Qt.  It's simply a finger-paint program that doesn't
depend on Qt, useful for verifying that the touch hardware works, and as
reference material when implementing XInput support in libraries.  Uploaded
to GitHub because I can't find the original source anymore.  It started out
as the same program that appears here:

but I simplified it a bit since then (you can still see how it was in the
git history though).
